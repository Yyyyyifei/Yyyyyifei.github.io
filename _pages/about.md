Hey, this is Yifei!

I am an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto, studying computer science and mathematics. My academic journey began as a mathematics specialist in economics and finance, motivated by a naive idea that this path would be financially rewarding. I took my first internship at an investment bank as an analyst. However, during my third year, I got exposed to the field of machine learning and became captivated by its potential.

At that point, I struggled with the decision of whether to pivot completely. Fortunately, being surrounded by world-class researchers at the University of Toronto helped me make up my mind, and I decided to dive into the world of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

I worked as a machine learning stack engineer at Cerebras Systems, a company building state-of-the-art computer systems for complex AI and deep learning applications for my Professional Experience Year (PEY). I had the privilege of collaborating with a team of passionate architects focused on performance optimization. In Fall 2024, I began my first research project under the supervision of Professor [Ashton Anderson](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~ashton/), where we utilize large language models for knowledge graph completion and logical reasoning tasks and submit my first paper to the Web Conference. Currently, I am working with Professor [Rahul G.Krishnan](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rahulgk/), focusing on evaluating and addressing distributional shifts in policy functions for optimal lab test ordering across hospitals.

I am still exploring my focus, but I am primarily interested in machine learning(ML) research and their applications in the field of science.

Hey, this is Yifei!

I am an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto, studying computer science and mathematics. 

For my Professional Experience Year (PEY), I worked as a machine learning stack engineer at Cerebras Systems, a company building state-of-the-art computer systems for complex AI and deep learning applications . I had the privilege of collaborating with a team of passionate architects focused on performance optimization. 

In Fall 2024, I began my first research project under the supervision of Professor [Ashton Anderson](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~ashton/), where we utilize large language models for knowledge graph completion and logical reasoning tasks and submit my first paper to the [Web Conference](https://www2025.thewebconf.org/). Currently, I am working with Professor [Rahul G.Krishnan](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rahulgk/), focusing on evaluating and addressing distributional shifts in policy functions for optimal lab test ordering across hospitals.

I am still exploring my focus, but I am primarily interested in machine learning(ML) research and their applications in the field of science!

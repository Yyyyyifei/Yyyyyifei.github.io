My academic journey initially began as a mathematics specialist in economics and finance, motivated by a naive idea taht this path would be financially rewarding and I took my first internship at an investment bank as an analyst. However, during my third year, I encountered the field of machine learning and became captivated by its potential.

At that point, I struggled with the decision of whether to pivot completely. Fortunately, being surrounded by world-class researchers at the University of Toronto helped me make up my mind, and I decided to dive into the world of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
